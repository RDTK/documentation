===========
 Templates
===========

Templates describe generic properties for certain recurring aspects of
:term:`projects <project>`. These could be build system instructions
or common settings for redmine instances.

Templates are organized according to :ref:`modes <deployment-modes>`
which describe different usages and therefore result in differently
configured Jenkins build jobs. This organization is reflected in a
directory structure consisting of the following sub-directories:

:file:`_common`

  Templates that can be used in multiple modes. This directory does
  not correspond to a mode itself. In case a specific mode uses a
  template from this directory, it is symlinked into that mode's
  directory.

:file:`toolkit`

  Used to generate build jobs which bootstrap a complete software
  distribution from scratch by installing it into a filesystem
  location. The generated Jenkins_ jobs are triggered in the
  appropriate order by an additional orchestration job -- no SCM
  polling is performed in this mode.

:file:`ci-deploy`

  This mode is used to continuously update a software distribution
  installed in a shared prefix whenever an SCM change to a software
  component appeared. This mode does not handle the bootstrapping
  phase correctly as it starts building software projects whenever a
  change is detected or an upstream project's build finished.

:file:`ci`

  Continuous integration mode for continuously building and testing
  software without installing it to a distinct filesystem prefix.
  Artifact copying is used between build job workspaces to handle
  dependency resolution.

Recipe Syntax
-------------

A typical template recipe looks as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   inherit:
     - foo-template

   variables:
     natures:
       - cmake

   aspects:
     - name:   cmake-cpp.cmake/unix
       aspect: cmake/unix
       conditions:
         unix: .*
       variables:
         aspect.cmake.environment: ${cmake.environment|}
         aspect.cmake.options:     ${cmake.options}
         aspect.cmake.targets:     ${cmake.targets}

     jobs:
       - name: toolkit
         tags:
         - toolkit
         - architecture-dependent
         - gcc
         - unix
         - linux
         variables:
           build-job-name: ${project-name}-${version-name}-toolkit-${distribution-name}
           cmake.environment:
             - PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${toolkit.dir}/lib/pkgconfig:\${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
             - "@{next-value|[]}"
           cmake.options:
             - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${toolkit.dir}"

             - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

             - CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH=FALSE
             - CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=FALSE
             - CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH="${toolkit.dir}/lib"

             - "@{next-value|[]}"
           cmake.targets:
             - install

Important Fields
----------------

The following fields are most important:

:samp:`{FILENAME}`

  This is not an actual field but the name of the :term:`recipe file
  <recipe>` with its extension removed (e.g. ``cmake-cpp`` for a
  :term:`recipe file <recipe>` named :file:`cmake-cpp.template`).

  Name of the template describing its purpose.

``variables``

  Variables specific to this template.

``variables`` Â» ``kind``

  ``"project"``

    "normal" project job

  ``"matrix"``

    matrix job

  :samp:`[ "{ELEMENT-NAME}", "{PLUGIN-NAME@PLUGIN-VERSION}" ]`

    arbitrary kind

``aspects``

  :term:`Aspects <aspect>` are specific configuration fragments to
  include in the generated Jenkins jobs.

``jobs``

  The kind of Jenkins jobs to generate for projects that have this
  template assigned.
